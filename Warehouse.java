/**
* Create a class called Warehouse that a warehouse might use to represent the actual storage
in it
* A warehouse should include the following information as instance variables:
* storage, a map of all the products that the warehouse has (type HashMap<String,
ProductQuantity>). The key is productï¿½s description
* In addition, provide a method named getProductQuantity(String description) that returns
the product that is being searched if there is any in the warehouse. If the product is found
in the warehouse, returns the ProductQuantity
* Provide a method addProductQuantity(Product, Number) that saves input products to the
warehouse storage. This method should take as inputs the Product and the quantity of
product. It should be a void method and should add the product to warehouse storage map*/
